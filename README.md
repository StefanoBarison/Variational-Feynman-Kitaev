# Variational-Feynman-Kitaev
This repository contains the source code for the VFK algorithm introduced in _ArXiv:2204._


The method has been implemented both in Python and Julia, using different libraries for quantum computing.
Every directory contains methods to construct the Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonian for the Transverse Field Ising Model and to find the ground state variationally using the VQE.
